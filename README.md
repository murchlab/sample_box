## Features to modify (Done)

1. Making the coaxial holes larger

Reason: We want a coaxial cable covered with solder to pass through.

Reason: To make more space for the coax-to-cpw transition structure

3. Adding a "V" shaped groove for indium seal
3. Adding a place for solonoid
4. Think about a good way to mount the sample box
5. Adding holes for thermalization
6. Adding a light-tight but not air-tight structure
